# Video Codec

This is a practice project to implement a simple video codec in C++. The coding process includes:

1. Digital Cousine Transform
2. Quantization
3. Run Length Coding
4. Huffman Coding / Arithmetic Coding

** The last step is optional. The source code of arithmetic coding is based on the 1987 paper.

Please refer to the README.txt for detailed elaboration.
